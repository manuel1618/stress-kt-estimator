This made the physics confusing and violated the\nprinciple that stress concentration factors are non-negative geometric properties.\n\nChanges:\n- Enforce Kt ≥ 0 in LP bounds \\(physically meaningful\\)\n- LINKED mode: display same Kt for Fx+ and Fx- \\(no sign flip\\)\n- INDIVIDUAL/SET modes: preserve signs in force matrix \\(remove abs\\(\\)\\)\n- Update validation to use consistent signed physics\n- Add comprehensive tests for new behavior\n- Document sign conventions in CLAUDE.md\n\nBreaking change: Kt values will differ from previous versions and physically\ninconsistent data \\(opposite force/stress signs\\) will now be correctly rejected.\nAll automated tests verify the new consistent behavior.\nEOF\n\\)\")",
